# QA System with LlamaIndex and Google Gemini:


# Overview

# This code is peresent in notbook--> expriment file

This repository contains a QA (Question Answering) system built using LlamaIndex and Google Gemini. The system leverages LlamaIndex for indexing and querying, while Google Gemini (including Gemini Embedding and GeminiPro) is utilized for embeddings and advanced processing.

Components
LlamaIndex: A tool used for efficient indexing and querying of text data./n

Google Gemini: A suite of tools for natural language processing, including:/n

Gemini Embedding: Provides high-quality embeddings for text data.


# Web Application
The QA system is deployed as a web application using Chainlit. Chainlit facilitates a streamlined and interactive interface for users to submit queries and receive answers in real-time.

For more details on how to use Chainlit in this project, refer to the app.py file.



GeminiPro: Advanced processing capabilities for sophisticated QA tasks.
Features

Efficient Indexing: LlamaIndex enables fast and effective indexing of large datasets.
High-Quality Embeddings: Google Gemini Embedding offers powerful text representations.
Advanced Processing: GeminiPro enhances the QA system with advanced NLP capabilities.
